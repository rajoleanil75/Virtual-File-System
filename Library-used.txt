Library Used in Virtual File System Project

  1. #include<iostream>
  ->In order to read or write to the standard input/output streams you need to include it.

  2. using namespace std;
  -> What that does is tell the compiler that symbol names defined in the std namespace 
  are to be brought into your program's scope, so you can omit the namespace qualifier, 
  and write for example

  3. #include<stdio.h>
  -> Input and Output operations can also be performed in C++ using the C Standard Input 
  and Output Library (cstdio, known as stdio.h in the C language). This library uses what 
  are called streams to operate with physical devices such as keyboards, printers, terminals 
  or with any other type of files supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to 
  interact with these in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties independently 
  of the individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.
  Streams are handled in the cstdio library as pointers to FILE objects. A pointer to a 
  FILE object uniquely identifies a stream, and is used as a parameter in the operations 
  involving that stream.
  There also exist three standard streams: stdin, stdout and stderr, which are automatically 
  created and opened for all programs using the library.

  4. #include<stdlib.h>
  -> This header defines several general purpose functions, including dynamic memory management, 
  random number generation, communication with the environment, integer arithmetics, searching, 
  sorting and converting.

  5. #include<string.h>
  -> This header file defines several functions to manipulate C strings and arrays.

  6. #include<io.h>
  -> io.h originally provided access to declarations for the low-level I/O primitives in Unix 
  and associated constants and such. Since quite a bit of code depended on it, many (most?) 
  compilers for other systems provided a header by the same name, and some library functions 
  that worked (at least mostly) like the ones in Unix.

  7. #include<unistd.h>
  -> In the C and C++ programming languages, unistd.h is the name of the header file that provides 
  access to the POSIX operating system API. It is defined by the POSIX.1 standard, the base of 
  the Single Unix Specification, and should therefore be available in any conforming 
  (or quasi-conforming) operating system/compiler (all official versions of UNIX, including macOS, Linux, etc.).
  On Unix-like systems, the interface defined by unistd.h is typically made up largely of system 
  call wrapper functions such as fork, pipe and I/O primitives (read, write, close, etc.).
